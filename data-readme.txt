# Real Data

The 'real' Data folder is empty, as the THYME and MIMIC III datasets, although public, require a license agreement for patient privacy reasons.

# MIMIC III Notes
In the paper we used a subsection of the MIMIC III notes that contained the words colon and cancer at least twice (from the NOTEEVENTS table).
The corresponding 498 notes can be identified by their ROW_ID in the NOTEEVENTS table, provided in the mimic3-notes.txt file.

# Artificial Data

The artificial data is created by taking some publically available reports from the web, and (almost randomly) assign some CONTAINS relations.
It is just to show what the data format looks like, and how the code should be called.
