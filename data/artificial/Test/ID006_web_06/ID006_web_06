October 2014:
A 69-year old Caucasian male presented with severe left lower quadrant pain.
He sought medical treatment after experiencing bloody diarrhea.
PMH was remarkable for hypertension that was being managed with telmisartan.
He was active and could perform his daily activities without restrictions or assistance.
Laboratory evaluation was remarkable for Hb 11.3 and CEA 6.5 ng/mL.
Colonoscopy revealed a fungating mass in the sigmoid colon which was biopsied.
Pathological findings: invasive poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
Molecular testing on the primary tumor was requested; no mutations were noted in KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA (quadruple wild type) and the tumor was microsatellite stable (MSS).
Chest, abdominal, and pelvic CT scan showed small bilateral lung nodules, a 3-cm mass in the right lobe of the liver, and a mass in the sigmoid colon measuring 10 cm.
Diagnosis, unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer.
Treatment was initiated with FOLFIRI + cetuximab and he appeared to respond well.
CT scans at 3 and 6 months showed decreased size of liver and lung nodules.

August 2015:
The patient complained of increased fatigue, and reported needing frequent breaks while performing daily activities.
CT scan showed increased size of the liver nodule (to 4 cm) and the appearance of 4 new small liver lesions (<2 cm).
He began therapy with FOLFOX + bevacizumab.

March 2016:
The patient complained of severe fatigue.
CT scan revealed progressive disease with no improvement in the primary and metastatic lesion size and/or number.
A new pulmonary nodule was seen in the right lung.
He was then started on trifluridine/tipiracil.
PET/CT at 3 months showed stable disease.
At 6-months, he reported less fatigue and some improvement in performing daily tasks.
