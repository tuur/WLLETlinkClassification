but occasionally heavy. She experienced recent weight loss of 10 lbs over the past
6 months not attributable to diet or exercise.

tration, 33.4 g/dL; mean corpuscular volume (MCV), 55 μm 3 ; and reticulocyte count,

blood urea nitrogen, 15 mg/dL; glucose, 124 mg/dL; sodium, 134 mEq/L; potassium,

128 lbs. Vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 132/86 mm Hg; pulse, 86

formance status was 90%. Sclerae were anicteric with pale conjunctiva. There was no pal-
pable adenopathy, and the lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiac examination
was normal. The abdomen was soft without distension or tenderness, and bowel sounds
were normal and present in all quadrants. There was no hepatosplenomegaly and rectal
examination revealed no masses or hemorrhoids.

WORKUP
Based on the initial laboratory findings, an iron panel was drawn; serum ferritin was 8
ng/mL. The patient’s history, physical examination, and laboratory data supported a diag-
nosis of iron deficiency anemia. Oral iron therapy 325 mg 3 times/day was initiated and
the patient was advised to take the iron with vitamin C at mealtime
