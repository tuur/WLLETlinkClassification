65-year-old woman with a loss of appetite, abdominal cramps, constipation, and blood in her stool.

History: Delores Murphy, a 65-year-old white female, was in good health until about 6 weeks ago, when she noted occasional cramps in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen associated with constipation. The episodes of cramping last about 30 minutes each and are most severe in the hour following her meals. She has taken laxatives which have partially relieved her symptoms, but she has had a decreased appetite and 12-pound weight loss over the past four weeks. In addition, she has become increasingly fatigued over this period. When questioned about her bowel habits, she reported bright red blood in her stools and a smaller caliber (i.e. diameter) of stool over the past two weeks.

Physical Examination: She appeared fatigued and distressed. Head and neck exams were normal, as was her thorax. Palpation of the abdomen revealed a 10 x 10 cm mass and tenderness in the left lower quadrant. Percussion over this area revealed a hollow, tympanic sound. Hepatomegaly was noted, and a hard and slightly tender liver edge was felt in the right upper quadrant. Bowel sounds were noticeably reduced. A stool sample was tested with Guaiac paper and was positive for blood.

Delores was referred to the radiology department to have an "air-contrast barium enema" procedure which revealed the silhouette of a 3 x 3 x 4 cm polyp in the distal sigmoid colon and a nearly 100% obstruction of the proximal sigmoid colon. The remainder of the large intestine appeared normal.

The suspicious lesions noted on the air-contrast barium enema convinced Delores's physician to examine her sigmoid colon via flexible sigmoidoscopy. During this procedure, biopsies of the polyp and obstructed area were taken and sent to the pathology lab. The obsructed area of the sigmoid colon appeared to be slowly bleeding prior to the biopsy procedure.
