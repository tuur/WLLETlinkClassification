December 2014:
A 51-year old Caucasian female presented with severe crampy right lower quadrant pain.
She had a 4-month history of occult bleeding, and significant weight loss of over 10 pounds in the last 8 months.
She sought medical treatment after experiencing severe cramping in the abdomen and bloody diarrhea.
Past medical history included GERD, managed with a proton pump inhibitor and appendectomy at age 35.
Laboratory evaluation showed grade 2 anemia (hemoglobin 8.7 g/dL) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level of 4.5 ng/mL.
Colonoscopy revealed an obstructive lesion in the ascending colon, measuring approximately 15 cm.
Pathological findings showed invasive and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with ulcer.
10 of 15 lymph nodes sampled were positive for tumor.
CT scan revealed widespread lesions in both lobes of the liver, and she was diagnosed with stage IV disease.
Mutation testing; KRAS-positive (G12D) and BRAF-negative.
Her ECOG performance status was 0.
She was treated with six cycles of FOLFOX + bevacizumab, and appeared to be responding well to treatment; follow-up imaging showed reduction in the size of the liver lesions.

November 2015:
Follow-up CT showed progression in the liver with new lesions and new small masses in the abdomen and pelvis.
Her ECOG performance status was 1.
She began therapy with FOLFIRI + bevacizumab.

December 2015:
The patient complained of severe fatigue.
CT scan revealed progressive disease with no improvement in the size and number of the abdominal lesions and the presence of 3 pulmonary nodules in the right lung.
She was then switched to trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102).
PET/CT at 3 months and 6 months showed stable disease.
Her ECOG performance status improved (PS 0).
