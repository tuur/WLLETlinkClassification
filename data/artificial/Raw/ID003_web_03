A 19-year-old man visited the gastroenterology outpatient department complaining severe left abdominal pain that developed 1 month ago. On physical examination, he was found to have a distended abdomen with severe tenderness on the left lower quadrant. An abdominal X-ray revealed a multiple stepladder sign. Abdominal computed tomography scan was then immediately performed which revealed a distal descending colon mass causing mechanical obstruction.

The patient had been living in Australia for his studies. He first felt a left-sided abdominal pain a month ago. He also had acute constipation and passed loose stool 1 to 2 times per week. He visited a private clinic in Australia, and the physician gave a diagnosis of acute colitis with regard to his abdominal pain and loose stool. Despite medication, he did not feel any symptomatic improvement so he returned to South Korea the previous day.

The patient was sent to an endoscopy room, and an emergency colonoscopy showed a large, fungating mass obstructing lumen at 40 cm from the anal verge. Through-the-scope stent insertion was performed to decompress the gastrointestinal tract. After stenting, a massive stool gushed out. No other polyp or mass was seen on the sigmoid colon and rectum.
