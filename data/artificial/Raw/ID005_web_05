A healthy 64-year-old woman presented in July 2012, with abdominal pain and "heaviness". A colonoscopy was performed and demonstrated a budding tumor in the cecum that easily bleeds. A histological exam showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed a Wall-thickening of the cecum without others abnormalities. She underwent a right hemicolectomy with a histopathological finding of a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading the muscularis propria. Twelve lymph nodes were removed and none showed metastases (pT2N0M0, Stage I), with no blood vessel invasion. The status of MSI proteins and BRAF were not verified. she was on regular fallow-up every 3 mo with a serum carcinoembrionic antigen (CEA) and CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. Sixteen months after her colectomy, a serum CEA level was 38 ng/mL, CT Scan demonstrated a single low-density lesion in the spleen which measures 4.9 cm of diameter. At Laparoscopic exam, no intra-abdominal lesions and no peritoneum or liver metastases were detected. Splenectomy was performed at that time. The Histological exam demonstrated an adenocarcinoma with spread the splenic parenchyma. The following appointment, delayed at 6 mo post splenectomy, revealed no recurrences. CT scanning showed no recurrence in the spleen area, liver, abdomen or the chest; CEA level was 12 ng/mL, however a fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan revealed a high metabolic activity in the abdominal cavity, mediastinum and left inguinal lymph nodes suggesting diseases recurrences. Chemotherapy was therefore commenced consisting of Fluorouracil (5FU), Leucovorin, oxaliplatine and Bevacizumab. After 6 cycles, there was no evidence of progression disease.
